dart-forcemvc-example
=====================

Live version running on DartVoid:
* [http://forcemvc.scorpiion.dartblob.com/](http://forcemvc.scorpiion.dartblob.com/)

This is a first version forked from [jorishermansdart repo](https://github.com/jorishermans/dart-forcemvc-example). Currently this app uses a forked version of the forcemvc package as well. In the comming days it will hopefully become less custom and more official. I would not recommend using this repo right now if you are not a dart-force or dart-force-mvc developer since it might change very soon. Check out the live demo anyway and we should have a good template and some instruction on how to run Force on DartVoid soon!
